#     # SkinVision Privacy Policy

#     At **SkinVision**, we take your privacy and the security of your personal information seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle and protect the pictures you upload while using our services, as well as how we use the data generated through our app.

#     ## 1. What We Collect
#     When you upload a photo to SkinVision, we collect the image file for the purpose of analyzing your skin's features, such as pores, acne, dark circles, and other skin conditions. We may also collect other data related to your skin analysis and the recommendations provided (e.g., skin type, routine preferences).

#     ## 2. How We Use Your Photos
#     - **Analysis:** The uploaded pictures are processed by our machine learning model to generate insights about your skin. These insights are used to provide you with personalized skincare recommendations.
#     - **Temporary Use:** Your photo will only be used for analysis during the session and will not be stored permanently on our servers unless explicitly stated.
#     - **Improvement of Service:** To improve our algorithms and provide more accurate results, we may use a limited set of anonymized images for training purposes. In this case, the images will be fully anonymized, meaning they will not be tied to any personal information or identifiable characteristics.
#     - **No Third-Party Sharing:** We do not share your uploaded photos or any other personal data with third-party companies for marketing or any other purposes unless required by law.

#     ## 3. Data Retention
#     - **Temporary Data Storage:** Photos are temporarily stored for the duration of your session and automatically deleted once the analysis is complete and the results are generated.
#     - **User-Controlled Deletion:** You have the ability to delete your uploaded photos from our system at any time by following the instructions in the app or contacting our support team.

#     ## 4. Data Security
#     We take the security of your data very seriously and use industry-standard encryption protocols to protect your uploaded photos and other personal information. While we strive to ensure the safety of your data, please be aware that no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the complete protection of your data from unauthorized access.

#     ## 5. User Rights and Control
#     As a user, you have the following rights concerning your personal data:
#     - **Access:** You can request access to any data we have collected about you, including uploaded photos and generated insights.
#     - **Correction:** If any information is incorrect or needs updating, you can contact us to correct it.
#     - **Deletion:** You can request that your photos and data be deleted from our system at any time.
#     - **Withdrawal of Consent:** You have the right to withdraw your consent for us to use your uploaded photos and personal data, though doing so may limit some features of the app (such as receiving personalized recommendations).

#     ## 6. Childrenâ€™s Privacy
#     SkinVision is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 16. If we become aware that a child under 16 has uploaded a photo or shared personal data, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.

#     ## 7. Changes to This Policy
#     We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of significant changes by updating the date at the top of this page or through other communication channels, where applicable.
